- **Added:**
  The ``use`` field of the :attr:`deprecated` attribute lets one specify
  a replacement for a ``Theorem``, ``Definition`` or ``Notation`` that is
  printed as part of the deprecation warning message and also used to suggest
  a quick fix in LSP based user interfaces
  (`#19300 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/19300>`_,
  by Enrico Tassi).
